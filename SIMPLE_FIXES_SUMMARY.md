# Simple Fixes Needed

## Issues Identified

1. **Service Dropdown Redirecting Up**: The Select component in the contact form is causing page scroll instead of opening dropdown
2. **Calendly Widget Not Visible**: The Calendly widget is not rendering properly due to container constraints

## Root Cause

The main Index.tsx file has JSX structure issues with unclosed tags that are preventing proper editing.

## Immediate Actions Needed

### For Service Dropdown:

- The issue is likely caused by the form being inside containers with scroll behavior
- Solution: Add proper event prevention and positioning to the Select component

### For Calendly Widget:

- The widget is constrained by aspect-video class and flex centering
- Solution: Remove constraints and give the widget proper space to render

## Quick Manual Fixes

Since the automated edits are causing JSX structure issues, here are the manual changes needed:

1. **Service Dropdown Fix**:

   - Add `onOpenChange` handler to prevent scroll
   - Ensure `SelectContent` has proper z-index and positioning

2. **Calendly Widget Fix**:
   - Remove `aspect-video` class from container
   - Remove flex centering that constrains widget size
   - Ensure widget div has proper dimensions

## Status

The file has underlying JSX structure issues that need to be resolved before making targeted edits. Consider checking the JSX tag closure structure around line 946.
